# Description <br> 
The team profile generator displays a roster of all the team members. For each team member, basic information is displayed. To generate the roster, the user is prompted through a command-line application that accepts the user's inputs. Once completed, the cards for each member is displayed. If the user clicks on the email, then a default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. If the user clicks on the github user name, then the team member's GitHub profile is displayed. The user also has the option to add more interns and engineers to the roster when prompter in the command-line.
